Reflection: 
What is an appropriate business scenario where a key-value document-based database like DynamoDB would be used?


The hands-on lab for this week shows me how quickly and how important DynamoDB is. DynamoDB will be useful for any organization that only has a small budget for running its data in the cloud. Amazon DynamoDB is the go-to for a company that needs to operate directly on AWS. It's very easy to set up and also very secure in terms of IAM setup. You won’t need to wait for a long period of time because the DynamoDB connection can be established in less time than you think. It has a very high performance with a low cost compared to SQL and other databases out there. The only downside of using DynamoDB is that it only takes three data types keys, string, numbers, and binary. “Furthermore, DynamoDB uses a throughput model for pricing and data processing by default. With this model, you estimate your read/write capacity needs before the service can appropriate the resources. In cases where you don’t really know your expected read/write volumes, you might under- or overestimate your needs, which can lead to batch-processing failures. Of course, you can use the on-demand pricing model to work around this, and DynamoDB will automatically accommodate your workloads as they ramp up or down. But that comes with the risk of bill spikes if your project’s traffic ends up higher than initially expected.”
